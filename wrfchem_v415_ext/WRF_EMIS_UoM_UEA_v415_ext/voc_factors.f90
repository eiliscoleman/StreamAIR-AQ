INTEGER, PARAMETER :: nvocs = 47, nvocsrc = 9
REAL :: factor(nvocs,nvocsrc)

! List of the 47 of the top 50 NMVOC species from the NAEI dataset (propylene, dichloromethane and tetrachloroethene
! are excluded as they are not mappable onto the current WRF chemical scheme) and the fraction of the whole NMVOC
! emission which comes from each species/source. The numbers are calculated from Table 2.13 of 
!
! "UK Emissions of Air Pollutants 1970 to 2005", UK Emissions Inventory Team, AEA Energy & Environment: C J Dore,
